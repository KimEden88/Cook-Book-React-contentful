            Join our workshop to learn some easy and fast cooking recipes. Our
            recipes are not just easy to cook but also super-delicious, wheather
            you want to surprise someone, just improve your eating habits or if
            you wanna show off in front of your friends (or enemies), we'll have
            just the right thing for you. Like that one time where I had that
            "friend" Dave and he was such a douchebag. So I invited him to
            dinner with some of my friends and cooked for them. Did it help me
            with that Dave situation? No! Did I profit in any way from that?
            Also no! I just drifted off while writing... Anyway..
            <span>Enjoy our workshop!</span>
